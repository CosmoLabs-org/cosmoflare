# CosmoDev-R2Go2 - Standard Operating Procedures

Project-specific SOPs that define how we do things in this project.

## What Are SOPs?

SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) are executable protocols that:
- Codify project-specific workflows
- Ensure consistency across sessions
- Chain skills and tools together
- Document how this project operates

## Global vs Project SOPs

| Type | Location | Scope |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Global SOPs** | `~/.claude/skills/sop-*.md` | All CosmoLabs projects |
| **Project SOPs** | `docs/sops/` (this folder) | This project only |

## Creating Project SOPs

```bash
# Create new SOP for this project
touch docs/sops/sop-<name>.md
```

Use the template from ClaudeCodeSetup:
- `plugins/internal/sops/_template/sop.md`
